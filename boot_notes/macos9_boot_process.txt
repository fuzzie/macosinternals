early mac boot notes

apply ptch 0xab89 (-2126)
don't apply ptch 0x9c (156)/0x38f (911) (due to being newworld)
load NameRegistryLib
.. so we can set 'yum ' according to the machine colour
.... (before drawing the startup screen!)
do ReplaceVideoDriverLib unless some key is held down, maybe?
then draw the startup screen (grab PICT)
[boot disk stuff?]

[.....]

load TimeManagerLib, call something??
apply ptch 0xaffd (-20483), which replaces the CacheMgr trap

[.....]

apply ptch 0xab34 (-21708); contains mac-io string and a lot of MP (multiprocessing) imports

[.....]

sometimes apply ptch 0x29 (41)?? doesn't seem to exist anyway

[.....]

apply ptch 0xaf5f (-20641), status 'LoadStartupDispatch'
